From the hint: `Do you think you can master rockstar?`, I looked for a rockstar decoder: [https://codewithrockstar.com/online](https://codewithrockstar.com/online)

Came out with some numbers, use an online decoder: [https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code)

It seams that there is an integer overflow. Pass an auction value of lesser than 2147483647, for example, I gave it 2147483000.

```
Rocknroll is right
Silence is wrong
A guitar is a six-string
Tommy's been down
Music is a billboard-burning razzmatazz!
Listen to the music
If the music is a guitar
Say "Keep on rocking!"
Listen to the rhythm
If the rhythm without Music is nothing
Tommy is rockin guitar
Shout Tommy!
Music is amazing sensation
Jamming is awesome presence
Scream Music!
Scream Jamming!
Tommy is playing rock
Scream Tommy!
They are dazzled audiences
Shout it!
Rock is electric heaven
Scream it!
Tommy is jukebox god
Say it!
Break it down
Shout "Bring on the rock!"
Else Whisper "That ain't it, Chief"
Break it down
```

Going to [https://web.archive.org/web/20190522020843/https://codewithrockstar.com/online](https://web.archive.org/web/20190522020843/https://codewithrockstar.com/online) asks us for input, so I used a python transpiler: [https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/rockstar-py](https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/rockstar-py) to make into python.

```py
Rocknroll = True
Silence = False
a_guitar = 136
Tommy = 44
Music = 1970
the_music = input()
if int(the_music) == a_guitar:
    print("Keep on rocking!")
    the_rhythm = input()
    if int(the_rhythm) - Music == 0:
        Tommy = 66
        print(Tommy)
        Music = 79
        Jamming = 78
        print(Music)
        print(Jamming)
        Tommy = 74
        print(Tommy)
        #They are dazzled audiences
        print(it)
        Rock = 86
        print(it)
        Tommy = 73
        print(it)
        #break
        print("Bring on the rock!")
    else:
        print("That ain't it, Chief")
        #break
```

Looking at it, input 136, then 1970:
