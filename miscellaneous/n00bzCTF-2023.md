Given file shows that its just a [American sign language](https://www.dcode.fr/american-sign-language)

Checking the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScu-EQD_7Kc1aF1FaHxX0JHypbWbd5oLy513nm9Prsdo6c7Dg/viewform) shows a flag input form, so checking the source gave the flag.

Looks like each 2 numbers correspond to the proton numbers of the periodic table. Just [decode it](https://www.dcode.fr/atomic-number-substitution) (the flag was slightly different tho).

## Numbers

Simple script to run this, just do not count 0 as the first number but 1.

```py
from pwn import *

r = remote("challs.n00bzunit3d.xyz", 13541)

for _ in range(100):
    r.recvuntil(b"How many ")
    num = int(r.recv(1).decode('utf-8'))
    r.recvuntil(b"appear till ")
    num2 = int(r.recv().decode('utf-8').replace('?\n',''))
    a = 0
    for i in range(num2):
        a += str(i).count(str(num))
    if num == 0:
        a -= 1
    r.sendline(bytes(str(a),'utf-8'))

print(r.recv())
```

## Big-Blacklist

Connecting to the server shows the source code:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
blacklist = ["/","0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","setattr","compile","globals","os","import","_","breakpoint","exit","lambda","eval","exec","read","print","open","'","=",'"',"x","builtins","clear"]
print("="*25)
print(open(__file__).read())
print("="*25)
print("Welcome to the jail!")
print("="*25)

for i in range(2):
        x = input('Enter command: ')
        for c in blacklist:
                if c in x:
                        print("Blacklisted word found! Exiting!")
                        exit(0)
        exec(x)
```

When I first saw this I was intrigued by seeing that we are allowed 2 inputs per connection. 
So logically I realised that the first input was to clear the blacklist, and the second to read the flag. 
I did `del blacklist[:]` first which empties the blacklist. Then `print(open("flag.txt").read())` to read the flag. 
Apparently my solution more elegant then the intended .pop() solution: `[blacklist.pop() for i in range(len(blacklist))]`. :)
