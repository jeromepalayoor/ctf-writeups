The picture was of a dam which I tried to reverse image search using Google which shows that it is form Russia.

Looking at the articles, I saw that the name of the dam was Kakhovka dam which wsa located in Nova Kakhovka.

Flag: `n00bz{Nova_Kakhovka}`

Looking the blog page I came across [this](https://blog.jatan.space/p/isro-chandrayaan-2-moon-landing-mission) blog post which has the same looking lander.
It was the Vikram lander wuth Pragyan rover set to land at [70.9° S, 22.8° E](https://blog.jatan.space/i/32155401/landing-site)

Flag: `n00bz{Vikram_Pragyan_70.9_22.8}`

Using exiftool I found that it was in San Francisco. The bridge looked familiar.

![image](https://github.com/jeromepalayoor/ctf-archive-hub/assets/63996033/0bf4e958-3dce-4c9c-b73b-18b4ba3bddaf)

It has to be one of these 3 bridges:

The far right bridge did not look anything like it.

The far left Golden Gate Bridge was not it either.

![image](https://github.com/jeromepalayoor/ctf-archive-hub/assets/63996033/227b927f-fafa-46e6-84b4-fe9a303dc171)

The middle bridge (Oakland Bay Bridge) had the exact same structure.

Looking at the angle,

It has to be within the rectangle region. At the end of the very straight long road is a building.

The building is a pier but there are many of them:

At pier 9, there was a straight road:

It seems that it could be the Vallejo steps:

Yes it is:

Searching the name [brayannoob on Github](https://github.com/search?q=brayannoob&type=users) shows a [user by that username](https://github.com/brayannoob). 

![image](https://github.com/jeromepalayoor/ctf-archive-hub/assets/63996033/fdde9efa-5181-4ca5-ab23-259a5fe853fa)

Looking at the [pinned repository](https://github.com/brayannoob/BrayanResearch) shows nothing interesting so I looked at the [commit history](https://github.com/brayannoob/BrayanResearch/commits/main). 
His [latest commit](https://github.com/brayannoob/BrayanResearch/commit/933cac4259ae48dde17252963da468f23684d908) reveals a username.

The title hints towards the platform [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). Which I then searched his username and found [this account](https://tryhackme.com/p/brayan234).

I [searched the username blackhat_abhinav on Github](https://github.com/search?q=blackhat_abhinav&type=code) and found [this instagram link](https://www.instagram.com/blackhat_abhinav/)

There was a secret link: [https://goo.gl/maps/gHbUHjqFyNcB7aqi9](https://goo.gl/maps/gHbUHjqFyNcB7aqi9), which leads to a Google maps place review:

Searching through various online platforms made me find [this Twitter account by the username Abhinav78082932](https://twitter.com/Abhinav78082932)

![image](https://github.com/jeromepalayoor/ctf-archive-hub/assets/63996033/63fd612d-4ac4-41ca-9086-803e6ac57f83)

His recent tweet was [a photo](https://twitter.com/Abhinav78082932/status/1667409456584609792):

I realised there was ALT text available which revealed the flag
